TASK 1- Landing Page - Titan Watch

I've implemented an interactive navigation menu for the Titan Watch landing page. The menu features a fixed position for easy access across all pages, with HTML providing the structural foundation. Using CSS, I styled the menu to align seamlessly with Titan's brand aesthetics, ensuring clarity and visual appeal. Leveraging JavaScript, I added dynamic functionalities: the menu changes its background and font colors when scrolled or hovered over, enhancing user interaction and navigation experience.
